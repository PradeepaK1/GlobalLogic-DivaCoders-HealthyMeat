# GlobalLogic-DivaCoders-HealthyMeat

To maintain good health its always important to remember that Preventing the cause is better than treating the symptoms. This project Healthy meat also aims to prevent the cause of certain health issues caused due to the consumption of old meat.

People nowadays are obsessed with eating a protein-rich diet to stay fit. Little do they know that the meat they proactively consume may not provide them the required health benefits but could cause them many health issues, including diarrhea, stomach cramps, and vomiting due to its lack of freshness.

Apps that provide the meat at your doorstep may promise freshness but not prove it. However, with our ML-based mobile application, you get to know the freshness percentage of the purchased meat and get a healthy recipe to cook it by simply clicking a picture of the meat purchased.

We have used a set of 100 images for training and testing, this model renders the accuracy of 81%

The libraries and concepts of Convolutional Neural Network along with Keras layering has been used to predict probability of the classes Stale or Fresh

You can find the details set of requirements from the requirements.txt file

If an image of any other object other than raw meat is sent to the model it classifies the object as 'UNRECOGNIZED'

We have used Streamlit to provide user interface for Uploading, Camera Access and to enhance the look and feel of the application

We have deployed this application through Streamlit cloud you can access from here
